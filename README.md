# GRIP_TASK_2_CLUSTERING
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under the GRIP internship. This project focuses on clustering the data in the iris dataset and predicting the categories to which various respective rows of data belong. It has 3 clusters, namely 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica'.
It can be opened on jupyter notebook as well as google collab. I've worked with google collab, so a different library is used to upload the csv file. if you are using jupyter notebook, give the path of the file then use read_csv(path) as usual.(only If you are uploading data from your local machine else you can pass the url into pd.read_csv(url))
