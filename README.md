# GRIP_TASK_2_CLUSTERING
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under the GRIP internship. This project focuses on clustering the data in the iris dataset and predicting the categories to which various respective rows of data belong. It has 3 clusters, namely 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica'.
